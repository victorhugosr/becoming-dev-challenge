### Challenge - 7 months to become a junior dev!

Often, we struggle to start something and stay committed until the end, and in programming, it's no different. So, I've decided to create a days studied/practiced counter with the following goal: to become a junior developer in 7 months of dedicated effort!
For this consistency to work, it's important to have a reward system. Something as simple as being able to see successful days on your computer screen can already help you stay on track and motivated.

It's an entirely web-based project, so I'll use HTML to structure the page, CSS to style it, and JS to make it come to life.

Seemingly simple, but it's a quite interesting and challenging project for someone who's just starting out.
